Homework 5 Assigment 

Welcome to my repository for HW Assigment. In this assigment I learned how to use REPL Interface. these are the steps I followed: 

-I began by copying my HW3 repository into this new repository. I wanted to keep the three levels of calculator without changing the code in case I need to go back to review. 

-After cloning both repositories, and copying, I added the calculator document including the REPL Interface Loop. 

-I also modified the test folder to include any changes.
